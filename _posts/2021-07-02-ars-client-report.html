                <h2>Definition of<br> Resilience</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="col-7 content-align pe-0">
                <p>Many people have encountered an adverse experience at some point in their lives. Yet, some bounce back quickly while others endure the negativity for a longer period. A distinguishing factor between these people is their level of resilience.</p>
                <p>Resilience has been widely defined as the ability to adapt to the changing environment and to bounce back from adversity and personal setbacks. Resilience has also been recognised as a measure of stress and the ability to cope with negative events, and can thus be defined as the personal qualities that enable an individual to thrive in difficult circumstances.</p>
                <p>Research suggests that resilient people adapt more successfully in response to major life events and traumatic experiences (Sarkar & Fletcher, 2014). Research also shows that resilience is not necessarily related to personality or intelligence (Carver & Connor-Smith, 2010).</p>
                <h3 class="mt-4 mb-2">Interpreting the Adult Resilience Scale Scores</h3>
                <p>This report is a confidential summary of the candidate’s responses to the Adult Resilience Scale, and provides descriptions to interpret the scores. The Adult Resilience Scale measures five dimensions of resilience and provides an overall Total Resilience Score. When interpreting the candidate’s results, it is important to remember that scores are neither good nor bad, and should be used as development opportunities.</p>

                <p>This level of coping capacity indicates a significant ability to deal with difficult issues as they arise, as well as a high capacity to put stressful events into perspective. Individuals operate recovery coping mechanisms and accept that a change in approach or strategy is required, so that stressful events are less likely to have a negative impact. Individuals may find it easier than others to act on decisions when under pressure and can easily apply the chosen solution to the problem.</p>

                        <p>A bell curve is the informal name of a graph that depicts a normal probability distribution. The raw scores on the Adult Resilience Scale are best viewed in the below bell curve distribution. The bell curve represents a ‘normal distribution’ of the general population. A normal distribution has the average (or mean) centred and an equal distribution above and below average like the curve below. The bell curve assumes there is an equivalent number of people above and below average, and a very small number of people two standard deviations above and below the average (mean).</p>
                        <p>The raw scores on the Adult Resilience Scale are converted to mean (average) scores and standard deviations across five intervals ranging from Very Low, Low, Average, High, and Very High.</p>
