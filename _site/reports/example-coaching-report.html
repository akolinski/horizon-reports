                <h2>Definition of Resilience</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="col-7">
                <p>Many people have encountered an adverse experience at some point in their lives. Yet, some bounce back quickly while others endure the negativity for a longer period. A distinguishing factor between these people is their level of resilience.</p>

                <p>Resilience has been widely defined as the ability to adapt to the changing environment and to bounce back from adversity and personal setbacks. Resilience has also been recognised as a measure of stress and the ability to cope with negative events, and can thus be defined as the personal qualities that enable an individual to thrive in difficult circumstances.</p>

                <p>Research suggests that resilient people adapt more successfully in response to major life events and traumatic experiences (Sarkar & Fletcher, 2014). Research also shows that resilience is not necessarily related to personality or intelligence (Carver & Connor-Smith, 2010).</p>

                <h3>Interpreting the Adult Resilience Scale Scores</h3>

                <p>This report is a confidential summary of the candidate’s responses to the Adult Resilience Scale, and provides descriptions to interpret the scores. The Adult Resilience Scale measures five dimensions of resilience and provides an overall Total Resilience Score. When interpreting the candidate’s results, it is important to remember that scores are neither good nor bad, and should be used as development opportunities.</p>
