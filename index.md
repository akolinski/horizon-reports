<div>
    <h1>Let's create a report</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a new file in the _posts folder</li>
        <li>You are done, give yourself a pat on the back</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>You can access your reports here:</p>
    <p>dev: http://127.0.0.1:4000/reports/example-report</p>
    <p>prod: https://akolinski.github.io/reports/example-report</p>
</div>

Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
